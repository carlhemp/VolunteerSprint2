					<h2>A Story of a Church Small Group leading campus events:</h2>
					<p>Dave and Megan are both on staff full time with Cru. They have been leading in a Metro setting for years but often times without a team.  However, they have a great small group that they have been part of for several years.  As the members of the small group have heard stories about the Cru ministry in their city they wanted to help.</p><p>Every year, Megan and Dave are able to run large outreach events on various campuses only because their small group members help pull off all the details of the event.  They have ran large scale evangelistic outreaches similar to the MAZE, E2 forums, and even fall retreats.  The small group runs point on all of the logistics of the event about once a year so that Dave and Megan can focus on interaction with current students, new students, and even ministry partners. This has allowed for their small group to really be part of what Dave and Megan are doing and also have given much needed lift to the ministry.

A few times a year she provides food for on campus outreaches.</p><p>Those outreaches include a  Friendsgiving outreaches the dorms, an Evangelistic Christmas Party, and Galentines outreach..
